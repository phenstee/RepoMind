# RepoMind

RepoMind is an autonomous AI software engineer for understanding, modifying,
and debugging unfamiliar codebases. The project is deliberately built in small,
verifiable milestones rather than as one monolithic prototype.

## Current status

**Milestone 1: LLM foundation** is complete. It includes:

- a Python 3.13 project managed with `uv` and a `src/repomind` package layout
- centralized configuration via `pydantic-settings`
- a reusable OpenAI client with text generation and structured output
- explicit retry and error handling
- normalized, typed response models
- mocked unit tests that do not require an API key or network access
- an optional manual live-API check script

**Milestone 2: repository ingestion** is complete. RepoMind can now safely
discover, filter, decode, and represent supported source files without calling
the LLM layer.

**Milestone 3: deterministic code chunking** is complete. RepoMind can now
transform `SourceFile` objects into ordered, citation-ready `CodeChunk` objects
using a deterministic line-based baseline.

Later milestones will add embeddings, semantic/hybrid retrieval, RAG, tools,
the handwritten agent loop, code editing, tests/self-correction, permissions,
memory, multi-agent orchestration, observability, evaluations, FastAPI, a
Next.js frontend, Redis, Docker, and CI.

## Repository ingestion

`repomind.ingestion` traverses a local repository, skips generated or ignored
directories, filters supported source files, and returns a
`RepositorySnapshot`. `SourceFile` objects expose only a repository-relative
path, preserving privacy around local absolute paths.

Supported extensions include:

```text
.py .ts .tsx .js .jsx .go .java .rs .cpp .cc .c .h .hpp .cs
.md .json .yaml .yml .toml .sql .sh .ps1
```

Default ignored directories include `.git`, virtual environments, caches,
`node_modules`, build output, and IDE directories. `.github` is deliberately
ingested when it contains supported text files because CI/workflow
configuration is meaningful project context.

Safety behaviors:

- symlinked directories and files are skipped
- files over 1 MiB are skipped and reported
- files with null bytes in an initial sample are treated as binary and skipped
- UTF-8 and UTF-8 BOM are supported; legacy `cp1252` text is used as a fallback
- undecodable files are skipped and reported
- line counts use Python `splitlines()` semantics

## Code chunking

`chunk_source_file` splits a `SourceFile` into smaller `CodeChunk` objects.
`chunk_repository` applies that process across all files in a
`RepositorySnapshot` and returns one flat, deterministically ordered list.

The current baseline is simple line-based chunking:

- `max_lines_per_chunk` defaults to 120
- `overlap_lines` defaults to 20
- chunk line numbers are 1-based and inclusive
- chunk indexes restart at zero for each file
- empty files produce no chunks

Overlap exists because code near a chunk boundary often depends on surrounding
context. Repeating nearby lines helps prevent that context from being split
completely across two retrieval units.

Chunking is intentionally deterministic and synchronous. It does not perform
embeddings, retrieval, or syntax-aware parsing.

## Architecture

The application is split into small, independently testable layers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Settings[Config Settings] --> Client[OpenAI LLM Client]
    Client --> Text[Typed Text Response]
    Client --> Structured[Pydantic Structured Response]

    Root[Repository root] --> Discovery[File discovery]
    Discovery --> Filter[Validation and filtering]
    Filter --> Load[Safe text loading]
    Load --> Source[SourceFile objects]
    Source --> Snapshot[RepositorySnapshot]
    Source --> Chunk[CodeChunk objects]
    Chunk --> Future[Future embeddings/retrieval]
```

`OpenAILLMClient` wraps the official OpenAI SDK. The rest of the codebase
depends on RepoMind's own `LLMResponse`, `TokenUsage`, and Pydantic response
models, not on raw SDK objects.

## Setup

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.13
- `uv`

Install dependencies:

```powershell
uv sync
```

Create a local environment file if you want to run live checks:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Then set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`. Never commit `.env`.

## Tests

Run the full unit test suite:

```powershell
uv run pytest
```

Run linting:

```powershell
uv run ruff check .
```

## Optional live check

With a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/manual_llm_check.py
```

This script makes real API calls and is not part of the automated test suite.

## Optional ingestion check

Inspect a repository without using the LLM:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/inspect_repository.py .
```

Include deterministic chunking statistics:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/inspect_repository.py . --chunks
```

## Design decisions

- **No agent framework yet.** Milestone 1 uses only the official OpenAI SDK. The
  first agent loop will be handwritten so its mechanics remain visible.
- **Provider abstraction stays small.** Normalized response models keep the
  SDK boundary contained and testable.
- **Secrets are externalized.** All environment configuration flows through
  `repomind.config.Settings`, and `.env` is gitignored.
- **Tests are offline by default.** SDK objects are injected in tests, so CI and
  local development do not require paid API calls.
- **Chunking starts with a deterministic baseline.** Line-based chunking is
  deliberately simple so later syntax-aware strategies can be compared against
  a stable reference.
